    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "The Models I have chosen are:Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC),Gradient Boosting, Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Classifier can be applied for ranking applications like in search engines, etc. It can applied to any applications with an objective function for which a gradient can be obtained.https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3270-mcrank-learning-to-rank-using-multiple-classification-and-gradient-boosting.pdf .this model produces good accurate results, this makes it a very good candidate for the problem\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "The strengths of this model are that it builds new trees which complement the already built trees. The new trees which will be built will help to correct errors in the previously built trees. This can produce highly accurate results with less trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "The weaknesses of this model are that it is harder to run parallely and hence are time consuming. They are also little prone to overfitting. They also have more parameters to tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Classifiers can be used for almost all applications where decision trees are used. Some of the modern world applications include Remote Sensing, Text Processing, etc.http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html This model runs quite fast and tends not to overfit much, this makes a good candidate for this problem as the dataset size is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "Random Forests avoid overfitting problem which occur in decision trees. They are quite fast to train and can be run in parallel. They are easy to tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "They are less accurate compared to boosting models. They also take time to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifiers are used widely in medical fields, for example in cancer detection. They are usually used in Large scale machine learning applications as they are much faster than regular Gradient Descent Algorithms. They are the most common classifiers used in developing Artificial Neural Networks.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282896425_A_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_Based_SVM_with_Fuzzy-Rough_Feature_Selection_and_Instance_Selection_for_Breast_Cancer_DiagnosisThe time complexity of this model is O(pn + kn), where p is the dimensions of the input and n is the number of training samples, k is the dimensions of the output. For the given dataset size this model would be quite fast and converge quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: Converges much faster than regual Gradient Descent. Due to the randomness invlolved it usually can avoid local minima better than regular Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons: It can get stuck at a local minima sometimes if the learning rate is made constant."

    "Decision trees look at the data and categorize them into categories. The model  is built on top of decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a construction engineer. His project is to finish the construction of a building. His task is to partition the work of construction between the people in the project. He first looks at the people and makes a flow chart after analyzing the skills sets of all people. For example, he looks at people with experience in construction and then assigns them to construction workers category, and he looks at people with inspection experience and assigns them to insepctors category, etc. This way he makes a list of decisions, so that the next time he sees a new people, he will be able to look at his previous decision chart and assign them to a correct category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that in the construction project described in the example above, there are a lot of \"weak construction workers\". Their performance level can be described in this way - \"If you had to pick some people randomly on the street and ask them to do the construction work, the performance of the weak constuctions workers will be better than the randomly picked people\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a reviewer, who is reviewing the works of these \"weak construction workers\". Now each of these weak workers make their own decisions for their own work using the same decision tree procedure explained above. These weak workers are greedy in their decisions and try to make the best decisions possible in order to do finsih the work. The weak workers start working one person after the other. When the first worker finishes his work, a new worker comes in, he first goes to the reviewer and looks at the mistakes the previous worker has made and learns from those mistakes and corrects himself so that he does not make the same mistakes again and also to get a better review from the reviewer. This process repeats everytime an old worker finishes his work and a new worker comes in. This way the best possible work will be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the example above, the current model works exactly as described in the example. The model contains decision trees which are comparable to the weak workers in the example. In place of a reviewer, the model has a loss function which measures the error in the predictions of the model. The loss function used usually is differentiable because it gives a way to check if the errors are decreasing or not. Decision trees usually have a set of parameters which help in the classification (think of them like tools of the workers). Decision Tree are added one at a time, after each addition the loss is calculated and then after checking the loss a new tree will be added which would reduce the loss even more. This will be done by correcting the parameters of the new decision tree (think of it like a worker getting new tools after looking at the old workers tools). Finally, when the loss reaches an acceptable level or when is it gone entirely the training process is stopped. The model can then be used to make predicitons based on the trained data.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.
